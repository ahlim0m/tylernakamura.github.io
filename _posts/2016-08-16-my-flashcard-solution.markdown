Remembering things is vital to any school or professional career.
Over the last few years, I have found that Flashcards have proven to be an extremely effective learning method.
It is something that I think could be very helpful for others regardless of their profession or status.
Prior to discovering software flashcards, I would write on many index cards by hand and use them as flashcards.
Unfortunately, this doesn't scale and doesn't have all the options that digital flashcards offer.

My favorite software solution for flashcards is currently Anki.
Anki is a desktop software for digital flashcards that also has compatible options on mobile devices.
At first glance, Anki doesn't seem very special or even robust.
Only after digging and playing with the software will you see all of the cool features.
Here are some my favorite features of Anki Software:

### 1. Reinforce Difficult Cards
This is my favorite feature that Anki offers that I haven't been able to find with any other flash card software.
When your deck starts to get large (100+ cards), it doesn't make sense to go through the entire deck every single study session.
It is a pretty big waste of time to go through cards that are really easy or you know really well.
The power of flash cards comes from the fact that you can test yourself on the cards that you need to help with.

Anki is designed to test you on the flashcards that you struggle with the most.
Depending on how well you know the card, Anki won't present you that card until it's time for you to see it again.

For example, when I know a card really well, I can press the "easy" key and Anki will keep track of how easy the card has been for you.
If you continually succesfully get that card the interval will continue to increase.
This is a scalable solution as your decks and knowledge continue to grow.

### 2. Open Source
Anki is completely open source and written in Python.
The project is licensed under the AGPL3.
The source code can be found here [github.com/dae/anki](https://github.com/dae/anki)

### 3. Nested Decks
Decks can be nested within one another.
This is awesome if you have a ton of decks that sometimes have overlapping cards.
This functionality allows users to create grand hierarchies.
Here is what my decks currently look like:

### 4. Cloze Deletion

This is a feature that I have recently been toying with.
Cloze deletion makes it easy to create many flashcards from sample texts.
Take a look at their example from the [anki documentation](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-deletion):

### 5. Charts and Stats
During your studies, all of your answers and decks are being tracked.
You can view your performance in a lot of different ways. Here are my current stats:

### 6. Media in Flashcards
Sometimes pictures or audio are neccesary for flashcards.
Depending on which class you are taking, it might be useful to insert media in your flashcards.
With Anki, this can be done with both audio and picture media.
Here is what a picture flashcard could look like.

### 7. Other

- Plugins
- Web Syncing
- Leeches
- LaTex support
- Card templates

### Quizlet
There are other flashcarding solutions out there, people will often mention [quizlet](https://quizlet.com).
I will admit that Quizlet is the biggest competitor to Anki.
However, quizlet isn't open source and doesn't have the same weak card reinforcing capabilities that Anki has.
I still use Quizlet as a search engine to find decks and just import them into my personal Anki solution.

Give Anki a try.
Incorporate flashcard studies both for recreational learning and schoolwork.
It only gets easier the more you do it.
