In the attempt to save my config settings and emails, I ran across [this article](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1104295).

The article explains how Thunderbird profiles work and how they can easily be migrated.

For more information on Thunderbird profiles, see [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1104295).
