Below is a list of products I want, or changed/new features in existing products

### Battle.net
In game recording/streaming should also record voices in group party

### Lastpass
- Have the ability to choose priority of auto fill when you have multiple accounts for a single URL (currently alphabetical or order added priority)

### iterm2
- ~~When splitting a window or making a new tab, the new window or tab would already be on the working directory.~~ [**WISH GRANTED**](https://coderwall.com/p/9xo7aq/open-up-iterm2-splits-in-current-working-directory)

### macOS
- cmd + tab needs to be faster. I have no idea why its so slow.
- contacts: adding to and from "groups" is horrible in its current state

### OBS
- Default value for container recording should be mp4 or matroska NOT flv

### Github
- Set up notifications to see changes for specific files or directories
  - ie, I may not want to get notified for all changes to a project but perhaps only to certain files

### rTorrent
- throttle torrents after a certain bandwidth cap

### Anki
- Without addons or plugins, change the import delimitter from card to card (can already change the delimitter from front to back)

### New Product Ideas
- A script that can convert wikipedia pages (or any text) into flashcards based on sentence structure regex matches
- Custom TV - a database for all video files. Video players randomly iterates through your videos and based on your criteria plays the videos.
 - could either be playing randomly or based on some order
 - if video was embedded in a web based browser, youtube videos could be incorporated in the database
- Photo/Video reminder. Database of all photos and videos. Database contains meta data about who is in the photos/videos (possibly with facial recognition)
 - sends photos and videos to people IN the photos based on criteria via email
 - Email for each person gives options to change notification preferences.
- A platform to make micro donations to many different charities, ie I can donate $5 a month, and it will be dispersed to many different organizations of my choice. Make donating easier!
