This year, I had the opportunity to experience my very first Defcon.
This post outlines how I plan on experiencing next years trip to Defcon.

## What is Defcon?

For the uninitatied, Defcon is a cyber sec conference that takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada every year.
At the time of this writing, Defcon has been occurring annually for more than 20 years.
Defcon is aimed towards the promotion of hardware hacking, pen-testing, social engineering, and cyber defense among many other things.
It started as a party for hackers and grew to be one of the largest hacker conferences in the world.
Defcon also has a reputation for catering to misfits and party animals.
There is indeed an emphasis on parties, alcohol and overall rebelliousness.
That being said, every person I encountered showed nothing but kindness and friendliness.


By day, the conference is filled with a plethora of educational opportunities including lectures, workshops, and competitions.
At this point, there are so many activities, that it is impossible to have participated in everything.
However, at night, the night is loaded with parties and social events.
These events are a gold mine for meeting fellow nerds and talking about computer things.
In my experience, its very rare to see so many techies in a party setting, so going to these night events and socializing with others is a fantastic rare opportunity.

## Defcon is about socializing

While the speakers that attend are generally brilliant and full of useful information, the point of the Defcon is not to go to class.
Anyone that is a Defcon veteran always emphasizes to me that meeting other hackers is the whole point.
With the exception of the sky-talks, all of the lectures eventually make it to YouTube.
So spending your time trying to absorb all of the content from all the lectures is rather moot.
This is a mistake that I made on my first day, I treated it as strictly an educational opportunity instead of networking opportunities.

I soon realized how many other interesting people were sitting beside me, waiting in line with me, or walking past me.
I began introducing myself to as many people as I could and thats when Defcon really became interesting.
Geographical origins and backgrounds always varied, what was consistent amongst all of them was a passion for computing and hacking.

## Be prepared for anything

This is a practical tip.
Anything can happen at Defcon at any moment.
Its important to first embrace this mentality and just roll with what happens.
Things don't always go as planned and there are always fun surprises that occur.
This means its important to bring any supplies you might need for the day.
I recommend bringing sufficient cash, a burner laptop, lots of water and a change of clothes everywhere you go.
You may find yourself in the penthouse suite of a hotel, a hacker pool party or a private capture the flag session.

## Be skeptical and inquisitive

Defcon is full of puzzles, flags and all kinds of interesting easter eggs.
Those who attend have occupations that range from criminals, feds, cyber security experts, sys admins, programmers, and engineers.
On my own personal journeys, I found drugs disguised as candies, hidden currencies, puzzles and secret parties.
The internet is generally considered to be dangerous and not always safe.
You have to imagine 25,000 hacking enthusiasts all using the same network.
It would be naive to think that all of them are going to behave.
Be careful about what internet you connect to, give everything a furrowed brow and a second thought.

## Conclusion

Defcon is an amazing place to be for any computer enthusiast.
I learned so much about hardware, lock-picking and overall cyber security.
Most importantly I met so many interesting people from all over the world.
If you ever have the opportunity to go to Defcon, focus on meeting people, and trying new things; it is well worth it.
