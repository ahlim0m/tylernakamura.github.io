Below is a list of products I want, or changed/new features in existing products

### Lastpass
- Have the ability to choose priority of auto fill when you have multiple accounts for a single URL (currently alphabetical or order added priority)

### MacOS
- cmd + tab needs to be faster. I have no idea why its so slow.

### OBS
- Default value for container recording should be mp4 or matroska NOT flv

### New Product Ideas
- A script that can convert wikipedia pages (or any text) into flashcards
- Custom TV - a database for all video files. Video players randomly iterates through your videos and based on your criteria plays the videos. Could be random
- Photo/Video reminder. Database of all photos and videos. Database contains meta data about who is in the photos/videos (possibly with facial recognition)
sends photos and videos to people IN the photos based on criteria via email
Email for each person gives options to change notification preferences.

### Github
- Set up notifications to see changes for specific files or directories
  - ie, I may not want to get notified for all changes to a project but perhaps only to certain files

### Anki
- Without addons change the import delimitter from card to card (can already change the delimitter from front to back)
