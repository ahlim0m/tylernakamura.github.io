## Overview
I am an avid [data hoarder](https://reddit.com/r/datahoarder).
This means that I love to collect data; much of which I will never use, but I believe should be preserved nonetheless.
Collecting data both for myself, others, or even historical purposes is a personal hobby of mine.
Currently, I have a mere 2tb of data stored (which I realize is a rather measly amount).
But what I lack in data amount, I make up for in organization.
How I organize my files is of extreme importance to me, everything I keep first goes through a rigorous protocol before it can be stored on my servers.
This document serves as a protocol that I use for my personal storage, and I believe it can scale to fit anyones purposes regardless of their storage needs.


## Personal Rules
- Never throw away data (almost)
  - if you are deleting data, its usually because you don't have a proper place to store it

File Storage Philosophy

Directories are upper case
ISO8601 is strictly adhered to
TV shows and movies follow Plex
1p, 2p and 3p
each entity in 2P has roughly the same structure as the top level directory of 1P
should the entire storage be inherited, a directory in 2P could easily be swapped with 1P
2P has a write/read and a read/only
