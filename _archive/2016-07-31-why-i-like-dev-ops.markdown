## What is Dev Ops?
The term "Dev Ops" is a term that is starting to be thrown around more and more in the last decade.
The dev ops role touches on many different tasks and thus can cause a bit of confusion.
Dev ops is purposed to enable continuous integration and continous development; essentially the handyman of software dev.
This could mean dockerizing an application, writing unit tests for regression testing, or ensuring hardy revision control.

## Devs Ops ==  Jack of All Trades
Consider the venn diagram above.
Note that the role of dev ops touches on each of the major roles in software development.
I love that in a dev ops role, I can get my hands dirty with a plethora of technologies.
As opposed to a strictly development role, it is often encouraged to specialize and master a niche.
Such mastery is certainly not a bad thing, but in the event of a technology being rendered obsolete, it places you in a tough position.
Being able to work on such a diversity of tasks and use so many different toys is not only engaging but serves as a medium for job security.

## Support Role
In team settings, I tend to prefer filling a support based role.
There is something about empowering others to do what they do best, that I find exciting.
Enabling others to excel in their own strengths is when a team really begins to reach its potential.
Dev ops is very much a supportive role, as it is all about giving the developers feedback on their improvements through quality assurance.
Dev ops also lends itself as supporting system administrators and operators by ensuring delivery of code.
