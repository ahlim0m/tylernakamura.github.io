Today, there is a great dependency on cloud storage.
People are beginning to rightfully move all of their digital content to cloud services.
The practice of backing up data is a good thing.
Disk failure, bit rot, and stolen devices are a good thing.
It doesn't matter how comfortable you feel with a computer, if any of those things happen, your data is gone (or at least corrupted).
Fortunately, great strides have been made in fields of data integrity and preservation.
Improvements are being made in speed, efficiency, size and safety.
Just recently, [Seagate announced the creation of a 60tb solid state drive.](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/seagate-unveils-60tb-ssd-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/)
The appeal for public cloud services has never been greater.

However, a problem arises for some.
This often puts the ownership in the hands of the cloud providers.
For most people, this may not be an issue.
But there is a small subset of people that would prefer to have their precious data maintained themselves.
The reasoning may be rooted in finances, privacy concerns or ethical dilemmas. 
Either way, there will always be this group, no matter how large, that will refuse to hand over their data to anyone but themselves.

Personally, self hosting software and data is a challenge and an art.
Only recently have I been exposed to this group, and I find it fascinating.
I wish I could say that this is the future, but currently there is so much technical expertise involved that I can't imagine such a lifestyle competing with services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

One day, I would love to be able to host nearly all of my software activities off of the public cloud.
For now, I plan on starting with moving all of my storage to my own NAS.
I have been looking at FreeNAS as the OS to store all of my data.
FreeNAS is a BSD licensed OS designed for NAS.
The appeal for a product like this for me is the license, cross platform compatibility and the UI.
FreeNAS is not the most lightweight platform, but the ZFS filesystem is the coolest cat in town and sounds like it will do a pretty damn good job of keeping your data safe.

While I think that cloud is the future, there are some things that should be kept in your personal cloud.
This belief only fuels my passion for open source and free scalable cloud solutions.
With FOSS cloud solutions, both corporations and consumers can enjoy the power of cloud.
