When loading a new terminal in iTerm (perhaps all mac), the .bashrc and .bash_aliases are not sourced by default. Instead, a .profile is sourced from your home directory.

To load your .bash_aliases and .bashrc file, in your .profile simply add:

```bash
source /path/to/.bashrc
source /path/to/.bash_aliases
```

A simple fix that I couldn't find elsewhere on the internet.
